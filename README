BigBlueButton LDAP authentication app
2015 (c) Spawnidze

This project forked from https://github.com/jtrobinson/Seneca-BBB-LDAP-work

I'm trying rewrite it for using with BigBlueButton 0.9.x based on Tomcat7

And now about installing app.

You may need to add the commons-lang-2.5 package to use the LDAP example. Find it here: http://www.classnotfound.com/package.html?jarId=64581

1) Installation
To get this app to work must run this shell script from within the repo directory
> ./setup.sh

This script copying app to Tomcat7 webapp directory: "/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps",
if you changed it, so you must modify "setup.sh".
